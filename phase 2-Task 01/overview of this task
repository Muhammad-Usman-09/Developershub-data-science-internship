Task 1: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing Dataset)

🎯 Objective
Predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing campaign.

📂 Dataset
  - Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Bank Marketing Dataset
  - Features: Age, Job, Marital Status, Education, Balance, Previous Outcome, etc.
  - Target: `y` (Subscribed = yes/no)

🛠️ Steps Performed
  1. Loaded and explored dataset  
  2. Encoded categorical features  
  3. Built classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
  4. Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, and ROC Curve  
  5. Applied SHAP for Explainable AI (model interpretability)

📊 Results
  - Random Forest achieved best accuracy & F1-score  
  - SHAP analysis identified **previous outcome**, **contact type**, and **duration** as most important features  

🚀 Skills Gained
  - Classification modeling  
  - Feature encoding  
  - Explainable AI (SHAP)  
  - Customer behavior analysis
