💼 Task 05: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

🎯 Objective:
To build a model that predicts whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer.

🛠️ What We Did:
    - Used the Bank Marketing dataset
    - Encoded `y`, `housing`, `loan`, and one-hot encoded multi-class columns
    - Trained a Logistic Regression model
    - Evaluated model performance and insights

📈 Results:
    - Accuracy: 89%
    - Customers with previous contact success and good credit more likely to accept offers
    - Duration of previous call also played an important role
